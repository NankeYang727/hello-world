Hi fellows,

I am a brand new in GitHub, toal loser in real life, hope i could learn sth. interesting and uesful in GitHub.
Man, for startors GitHub is really hard to operate and understand.

What i would become after one or two years, hope every unfortunate things change to fortune in the end.

New Edition with new branch. So hard. :(
